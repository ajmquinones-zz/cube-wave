Programming challenge #1: Cubic Wave
------------------------------------

My attempt to re-create the cube wave effect from https://twitter.com/beesandbombs/status/940639806522085376 using plain javascript and threejs library (http://threejs.org/). There's still a few quirks on the original that I can't quite reproduce like the mesmerizing smooth wave form at the center but steep waves at the corners. Should probably use a different wave function instead of sine.
